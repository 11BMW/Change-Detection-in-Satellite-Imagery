# Change-Detection-in-Satellite-Imagery

It employes Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering techniques over difference image to detect changes in multi temporal images satellite imagery.

Best thing would be to follow my blog-post for implementation. The description about how the change detection is performed on satellite imagery can be read from my blog:


I have also uploaded sample images of multi-temporal pairs taken from USGS website. 

It is a python implementation using Scikit-learn ML library.
